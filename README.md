# 🚀 Hand Gesture Recognition Using MediaPipe

Welcome to **Hand Gesture Recognition** — a real-time project that detects your hand movements (0️⃣ to 5️⃣, ✌️ OK sign, 👍 Thumbs up, ✋ High-five, ✨ Best of Luck) using your laptop or PC camera!

---

## ✨ Features
- Real-time hand tracking using **MediaPipe**.
- Finger counting (0 to 5).
- Detect "OK" sign.
- Detect "Thumbs Up" gesture.
- "Best of Luck" hand sign recognition.
- Smooth FPS (~25-30) on normal laptops.
- No external deep learning model training needed.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- OpenCV 🎥
- MediaPipe 🤖 (pre-trained hand landmarks model)
- Math 📐
